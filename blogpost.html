            <p class="font2">Righto, it's 4-4! Who would have thought? Both RCB and DC, teams that looked like finishing
                in the top 2 for the majority of the season, have tasted 4 successive defeats and quite worryingly, it
                came at the back end of the tournament. A certain legend once noted that 'It's better to peak early than
                not to peak at all." Speaking of peaks, we have, well almost, reached the peak of the tournament with
                the last of group games scheduled tomorrow at Sharjah. It's SRH v MI - the contest that KKR will watch
                with keen interest as they desperately hope for a MI victory. As for Hyderabad, a simple equation
                beckons: win and they are through for the playoffs (third place) for the fifth successive time. It has
                been that kinda season folks. Hope you enjoyed our coverage tonight. Until next time, this is Raju
                Peethala greeting goodnight on behalf of my colleagues Akshay Maanay, Sriram AS, Hariprasad Sadanandan,
                Pradeep Krishnamurthy and Siva. *Curtains down*
                Anrich Norje | Player of the Match: I said it time and time again, it's just doing the basics right and
                wasn't about something special from one guy. Coming into this game, small things started feeling better
                and I think those small things, once you get that right, you get your rhythm. We were thinking to make
                them hit to the bigger boundary and stick to our plans against each batsmen. There was little bit dew at
                the end of our innings and we tried not to be predictable. Yorker would have been the obvious option and
                we wanted to change it and see how it goes and wanted to hit the hard length. Having a bit of extra pace
                always helps. All ready for the playoffs (smiles).
                Shreyas Iyer | DC skipper: Very chuffed with the performance. We knew it was a do-or-die and an
                opportunity for us to get to the second spot. We were really motivated. The teams winning in the latter
                half completely changed the scenario of the table and it was really commendable. Really happy with how
                the tournament has gone so far. The bowlers were really up with their plans and they knew what they had
                to execute. Nortje was really good and it worked out pretty well. Kudos to the way the bowlers bowled.
                We are one of the best teams in the tournament and we need to stick to the basics and if we try and
                execute our plans, the results will come.
                Ajinkya Rahane: Ricky told me that I am going to bat at number three. It’s a good position to bat at.
                Our bowlers did really well for us. I enjoyed the partnership with Shikhar. The communication between us
                was all about intent. We weren’t thinking about any target. It was all about playing proper cricketing
                shots. I wanted to finish the game. We all know how funny the sport is. We’ve seen how things have
                happened in this IPL. Feels great to win in the end.
                Virat Kohli | RCB skipper: It's a mixed bag. As I said at the toss, you come to games to try and get the
                result your way. Through the 11th over, the 17.3 mark was informed by the management. I think we
                controlled the middle phase really well and they could've taken the game away from us. We are happy that
                we've qualified. Top two would've been really very nice. But I think we've played good enough cricket to
                earn a qualification spot. You could say just before the qualification, the mindset was a little bit
                tentative. We've got two games to reach the final. We have a shot, an opportunity and that's all we want
                as a team. I'm sure the guys will be excited about what's ahead for us. We can be more more brave with
                the bat in pockets. With the ball, we were decent, probably we could have a strong Powerplay which is
                our strength. If we implement those things, we'll be at the right end of the result. It's important to
                stay positive. There are going to be learning along the way, but we are glad that we are through. We'll
                have to assess what's happening, hopefully they'll (Morris and Saini) be fine by the time we play our
                next game. And see how they go in the next few days.</p>
